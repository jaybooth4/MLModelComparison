# MLModelComparison
Final Project for EECE 5644
The .png files are all variations of different steps of processing our writing into an identical format as EMNIST data with the final variations all being the booth letters with the suffix PRO attached if they have been processed.
The Processing is done in the file OurConversion.ipynb
The other main code file is the EMNIST Import and Application by SKLearn.ipynb where we import the EMNIST dataset, have a method for visualizing it using ASCII characters and attempt to apply some of the models we decided to use using their corresponding SKLearn functions
